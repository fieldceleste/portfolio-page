              <p> Before <em>Epicodus</em> I was originally in the management and cosmetology field for almost
                8 years. I then went back to school to finish my degree in business management at Marylhurst
                University. After working in the service industry for so long it was nice to finally be able to have
                an office job. But even after doing office work I still did not feel challenged or stimulated at my current
                job, and this is why I have chosen the path of web development. I took some web development classes
                in college back when facebook was just coming out, and web design was much different especially css.
                The way it is now it so much easier, as far as reading and inputting code.</p>

              <p> When not doing school full-time, I enjoy many fun outdoor activities. I have
                recently moved back to Portland from Central Oregon, which was an awesome place to live for
                many reasons. When living over there I got to expereince many new cool places to
                hike, and gained a new favorite pass time- going to the natural hot springs. I am
                really into winter sports, and enjoy snow shoeing and snowboarding. I recentley learned how to rock climb and that has been my new past time.  I have two
                adorable pets, a pomeranian named Bentley and cat named Oliver. When not doing
                outdoor activities, I travel which is my number one passion. I really enjoy learning history and
                culture from new and exciting places. My favorite country, and a place I dream of living one day is
                <em>France</em>.</p>
